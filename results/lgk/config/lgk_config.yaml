query: "query"            # IMPORTANT, identifier of the sequence in the trees, default query name is used

validation: NO            # predicted an extant sequence for validation purpose
transition: NO            # predict only values in the case of 3 or more transitions between AA in the lineage

# AA indices to use, see indices/aaindex.csv to get all indices currently supported by predictor, please add custom one
